Overview

Kids
Supervised
experience
on
YouTube
Every
family
has
a
different
approach
to
using
technology
exploring
online
and
setting
digital
ground
rules
Thatâ
s
why
we
offer
options
and
controls
for
parents
and
caregivers
to
help
them
decide
which
YouTube
experience
is
best
for
their
family

YouTube
Kids
is
a
dedicated
app
built
from
the
ground
up
with
kids
in
mind
It
was
launched
in
2015
to
give
kids
a
safer
and
simpler
place
to
explore
their
interests
through
online
video
This
separate
app
is
a
filtered
version
of
YouTube
and
has
a
much
smaller
set
of
channels
and
videos
available
than
the
YouTube
app
and
website
This
is
because
we
work
to
identify
content
that
is
age
appropriate
adheres
to
our
quality
principles
and
is
diverse
enough
to
meet
the
varied
interests
of
kids
globally
Millions
of
viewers
use
YouTube
Kids
every
week
and
we
strive
to
offer
ways
for
all
types
of
parents
to
create
an
experience
that
works
best
for
the
individual
needs
of
their
child
and
family
Parents
can
choose
from
three
age
based
content
levels
Preschool

Older

decide
to

Supervised
experience
on
YouTube
In
2021
we
launched
a
new
choice
for
parents
who
have
decided
their
tweens
or
teens
are
ready
to
explore
YouTube
with
a
supervised
account
Parents
link
their
childâ
s
Google
Account
to
their
own
before
granting
them
access
to
YouTube
and
then
choose
from
content
settings
that
generally
align
with
content
ratings
for
pre
teens
and
older
The
experience
looks
much
like
YouTubeâ
s
flagship
app
and
website
but
with
adjustments
to
the
content
a
child
can
find
and
watch
features
they
can
use
default
account
settings
and
ad
protections
The
experience
also
works
with
Family
Link
offering
additional
parental
controls
to
help
guide
children
as
they
learn
play
and
explore
online
