What
happens
when
I
change
my
organization
s
name
After
changing
your
organization
s
name
your
old
organization
name
becomes
available
for
someone
else
to
claim
When
you
change
your
organization
s
name
most
references
to
your
repositories
under
the
old
organization
name
automatically
change
to
the
new
name
However
some
links
to
your
profile
won
t
automatically
redirect
Changes
that
occur
automatically
GitHub
automatically
redirects
references
to
your
repositories
Web
links
to
your
organization
s
existing
repositories
will
continue
to
work
This
can
take
a
few
minutes
to
complete
after
you
initiate
the
change
You
can
continue
pushing
your
local
repositories
to
the
old
remote
tracking
URL
without
updating
it
However
we
recommend
you
update
all
existing
remote
repository
URLs
after
changing
your
organization
name
Because
your
old
organization
name
is
available
for
use
by
anyone
else
after
you
change
it
the
new
organization
owner
can
create
repositories
that
override
the
redirect
entries
to
your
repository

more
information

Managing
remote
repositories
Previous
Git
commits
will
also
be
correctly
attributed
to
users
within
your
organization
If
the
account
namespace
includes
any
public
repositories
that
contain
an
action
listed

If

GitHub
transfers
the

By

you
may
break

that
