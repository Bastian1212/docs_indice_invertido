Our
product
roadmap
is
where
you
can
learn
about
what
features
we
re
working
on
what
stage
they
re
in
and
when
we
expect
to
bring
them
to
you
Have
any
questions
or
comments
about
items
on
the
roadmap
Share
your
feedback
via
GitHub
public

discussions
The
roadmap
repository
is
for
communicating
GitHub
s
roadmap
Existing
issues
are
currently
read
only
and
we
are
locking
conversations
as
we
get
started
Interaction
limits
are
also
in
place
to
ensure
issues
originate
from
GitHub
We
re
planning
to
iterate
on
the
format
of
the
roadmap
itself
and
we
see
potential
to
engage
more
in
discussions
about
the
future
of
GitHub
products
and
features
If
you
have
feedback
about
this
roadmap
repository
itself
such
as
how
the
issues
are
presented
let
us
know
through
general
feedback
in
GitHub

Roadmap
stages
The
roadmap
is
arranged
on
a
project
board
to
give
a
sense
for
how
far
out
each
item
is
on
the
horizon
Every
product
or
feature
is
added
to
a
particular
project
board
column
according
to
the
quarter
in
which
it
is
expected
to
ship
next
Be
sure
to
read
the
disclaimer
below
since
the
roadmap
is
subject
to
change
especially
further
out
on
the
timeline
You
ll
also
find
an
Exploratory
column
which
is
used
in
conjunction
with
the
in
design
and
exploring
release
phase
labels
for
when
no
timeframe
is
yet
available
GitHub
Enterprise
Server
has
major
releases
on
a
quarterly
basis
and
minor
releases
on
a
monthly
basis
Once
we
know
what
version
we
are
delivering
a
feature
we
will
update
