Information
For
what
purpose
was
the
dataset
created
test
Additional
Information
These
data
are
the
results
of
a
chemical
analysis
of
wines
grown
in
the
same
region
in
Italy
but
derived
from
three
different
cultivars
The
analysis
determined
the
quantities
of
13
constituents
found
in
each
of
the
three
types
of
wines
I
think
that
the
initial
data
set
had
around
30
variables
but
for
some
reason
I
only
have
the
13
dimensional
version
I
had
a
list
of
what
the
30
or
so
variables
were
but
a
I
lost
it
and
b
I
would
not
know
which
13
variables
are
included
in
the
set
